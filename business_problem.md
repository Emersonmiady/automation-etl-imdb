# 1. Context
In this project, we will work at a media company that is assembling a new product squad. The goal of this squad is to start working on marketing campaigns based on movie releases. For this purpose, we will need to understand some consumption behaviors of users engaging with this type of media and the market trends. One of the suggestions made by the product team was exploring IMDb data.

# 2. Possible dimensions for analysis
- Volume of releases per year;
- Releases by language;
- Release trend by genre;
- Number of participants per release;
- Number of genres in which each participant works;
- Most frequent genres by type of release;
- Average rating by genre over the years.

1. Realese table: release, type of release, year, language, genre, number of participants, avg rating
